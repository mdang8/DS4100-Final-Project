The RateBeer API contains five different queries to retrieve data:  
 1. `beer(id: ID!): Beer`  
 2. `beerReviews(beerId: ID! first: Int after: ID): ReviewList`  
 3. `topBeers(first: Int after: ID): BeerList`  
 4. `beerSearch(query: String first: Int after: ID): BeerList`  
 5. `beersByBrewer(brewerId: ID! first: Int after: ID): BeerList`  
 
A big limitation I had was that RateBeer's API had a limit of 5,000 requests/month, so I had to try
to optimize my data retrieval methods to get the most data with as few API requests as I could. To 
reduce the number of API requests made, as well as the time required to retrieve all of the 
individual beer data, the `beersByBrewer` query was the best option. This query returns a list of
all the beers by the specified brewer.  

Every API request is required to have a registered API key provided by RateBeer. This key is
acquired by submitting an application with relevant information about how the RateBeer data will be
used. A query is required in GraphiQL format containing the brewer ID and data fields to be included
in the response. Three headers are also required: `Content-Type` (set to `application/json`),
`Accept` (set to `application/json`), and `x-api-key` (set to the API key string).
```{r}
library("httr")
# config file contains secret API key (left out of submission)
source("./config.r")

retrieveBeersByBrewer <- function(brewerId) {
  # Makes an API request to retrieve data on all of the beers for the brewery with the given brewer 
  # ID.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   brewerId: the ID of the brewery
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   A response from the API request
  
  # RateBeer API Key from config file
  API_KEY <- ratebeer_API_KEY
  # RateBeer API endpoint
  url <- "https://api.ratebeer.com/v1/api/graphql"
  # GraphiQL query to send in API request
  query <- paste("query { beersByBrewer(brewerId: ", brewerId, ", first: 1000)",
                 "{ totalCount items { ",
                 "name abv ibu calories isRetired overallScore averageRating ratingCount ", 
                 "style { name } brewer { name state { name } } }}}", sep = "")
  # makes the POST request with all of the necessary parameters
  # requests have to contain a "Content-Type", "Accept", and "x-api-key" header
  apiData <- POST(url, body = list(query = query, variables = "{}", operationName = NULL),
                  encode = "json", add_headers("Content-Type" = "application/json",
                                               "Accept" = "application/json",
                                               "x-api-key" = API_KEY))
  
  print(paste("Made a request for brewerId:", brewerId))
  return(apiData)
}
```


Although, the `beersByBrewer` query greatly reduces the number of ID's to locate, there's
still thousands of breweries that we need to identify to make all of the requests. One way to make
this easier is to work with a single state and find all of the breweries in that state. There's no
API query that lets us easily achieve this. However, on RateBeer's website it has pages for every 
state that lists all of the breweries in that particular state with their brewery ID, so we can 
scrape the website to acquire those ID's.

The first step to doing this is to find the URL's for each state's brewery page. We can do this by 
visiting a page that lists all of the states and countries that have breweries in RateBeer's
database and scraping the URL's for every state. All of the locations and associated URL's are 
conveniently within the same `div` HTML block and are represented as `a` tags with `href` 
attributes. A minor inconvenience is that the single `div` block contains all of the `a` tags on the
same level, preventing us from simply selecting every tag. But this is resolved by selecting only 
the first 51 *(50 states + Washington DC)* tags, as they are all located at the top of the block.

Once we have all of the selected tags, we extract the `href` values to get the URL's and parse them
to get the relevant information. Here's an example URL string for the state of Massachusetts: 
`/breweries/massachusetts/21/213/`. Since we have a vector of URL's, we will use the `map()` function
provided by the `purrr` library to apply the parsing to each one. To do the parsing, we will use 
regular expressions to extract the different parts of the URL that we want. First, we use a regex to 
match the state's name that is located between "/breweries/" and "/". We then apply some text
manipulation to fix spacing and capitalization. Next, we use another regex to match the state's ID 
that is between "/" and "/213/". Now that we have that information, we store them in a list for easy 
retrieval.
```{r}
library("rvest")
library("xml2")
library("purrr")

parseStateUrls <- function() {
  # Scrapes the RateBeer webpage with all of the brewery locations to retrieve the URL's for each
  # state.
  # 
  # Args:
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   A list of list of state information. The state information consists of: the state name, the 
  #   associated ID, and the associated URL.
  
  # RateBeer URL for brewery locations by country
  breweriesUrl <- "https://www.ratebeer.com/breweries/"
  # finds all of the URL's for the 50 states and Washington DC
  page <- read_html(breweriesUrl) %>%
    # selects the first 51 URL's (50 states + Washington DC)
    html_nodes("#default a:nth-of-type(-n+51)") %>%
    # selects the URL
    html_attr("href")
  
  # extracts the state name, associated ID, and associated URL and stores them in a list
  stateIdList <- map(page, function(urlText) {
    # Regex to find the state name in the URL
    # Example string: "/breweries/massachusetts/21/213/"
    stateNameRegex <- "(?<=\\/breweries\\/)([a-z\\-]*)(?=\\/)"
    # Regex to find the state ID in the URL
    idRegex <- "(?<=\\/)([0-9]*)(?=\\/213\\/)"
    stateName <- regmatches(urlText, regexpr(stateNameRegex, urlText, perl = TRUE)) %>%
      # replaces the "-" for multi-word states
      gsub("-", " ", ., fixed = TRUE) %>%
      # capitalizes the first letter of each word in a state's name
      tools::toTitleCase()
    id <- regmatches(urlText, regexpr(idRegex, urlText, perl = TRUE))
    # special case for Washington DC where the toTitleCase() function doesn't completely work
    stateName <- ifelse(stateName == "Washington Dc", "Washington DC", stateName)
    
    list("name" = stateName, "id" = id,
         "url" = paste("https://www.ratebeer.com", urlText, sep = ""))
  })
  
  return(stateIdList)
}

parseStateUrls()
```


When we have the URL's for every state's brewery page, we will need to parse the pages for the 
breweries. We can use a similiar strategy to parsing the state URL's since the pages have a 
similiar structure. The difference is that the state breweries pages has a `table` element with each
brewery URL in a `td` cell, so we have to adjust our selector string. Another thing is that each 
cell contains two `a` tags; the first one for the brewery and the second one for the city it is
located in. To make sure we're selecting the correct tag, we specify in the selector string to only
get the first `a` tag in each cell.

*__Note:__ After using this selector string for about half of the states, I realized that there were actually two `table` tags on the page both with the same `brewerTable` ID attribute...The second table was filled with cells for inactive breweries. I decided that I didn't want to include that data, so I changed the selector string to look for a `div` block with the `searchable` class, which is where the active breweries table is located. Since I didn't realize that before I started making all of the API requests, and having no easy way to identify inactive breweries, I decided to just keep all the ones already existing in the database. If I had more API calls to spare, I would've re-done the data retrieval to only get active breweries, but that wasn't an option at this point 🙁.*

After applying the HTML parser, we get a vector of brewery URL's that we have to then parse for the 
brewery ID's. The brewery name isn't important here because the API query only requires the ID.
Here's an example URL string for Night Shift Brewing: `/brewers/night-shift-brewing/14248/`. To 
parse the URL's, we will use a regular expression to match the variable length string of numbers in
between the forward slashes and return a vector containing all of the ID strings.
```{r}
library("rvest")

parseStateBreweryIds <- function(stateUrl) {
  # Scrapes the RateBeer webpage of the given state URL to retrieve all of the brewery ID's for that
  # state.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   stateUrl: the URL for the state's RateBeer webpage
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   A vector containing all of the brewery ID's for the state
  
  page <- read_html(stateUrl) %>%
    html_nodes("div.searchable #brewerTable td a:nth-child(1)") %>%
    html_attr("href")
  # Regex to find the brewery ID number in a brewery link
  # Example string: "/brewers/night-shift-brewing/14248/"
  regex <- "(?<=\\/)([0-9]*)(?=\\/)"
  # applies the Regex to find all of the brewery ID's in the vector of brewery links
  ids <- regmatches(page, regexpr(regex, page, perl = TRUE))
  
  return(ids)
}

parseStateBreweryIds("https://www.ratebeer.com/breweries/massachusetts/21/213/")
```


Now, with functions to find all of the state URL's and brewery ID's, we can make requests to 
retrieve all of the beers for a state! The `retrieveBeersByState()` function takes in a list 
containing information for an *individual* state. The `parseStateUrls()` function from above returns
a list of lists with state information, so we can select any list element from it to use as the 
argument.

The `retrieveBeersByState()` function takes the state's URL and calls the `parseStateBreweryIds()`
function to get a vector of all of the ID's for that state's breweries. It then calls the 
`retrieveBeersByBrewer()` for each ID with a timeout of 1 second between each call. This timeout is
required because the RateBeer API has a rate limit of 1 request/second. The `parseBeers()` function 
is then applied to the results to extract the relevant data for the beers.
```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("httr")
library("jsonlite")
library("purrr")

parseBeers <- function(res) {
  # Parses the beers from the request response.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   res: the response from the API request
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   The parsed beer data
  
  dataContent <- content(res, type = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
  parsedData <- fromJSON(dataContent, flatten = TRUE)
  df <- parsedData$data$beersByBrewer$items
  
  return(df)
}

retrieveBeersByState <- function(state) {
  # Makes API requests for all of the breweries in the given state and returns a data frame 
  # containing the data.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   state: the list of state information
  # 
  # Returns:
  #   A data frame containing the beer data for the given state
  
  # a vector of all of the brewery ID's for the given state
  ids <- parseStateBreweryIds(state$url)
  beerDf <- ids %>% map(function(id) {
    # RateBeer API requests are limited to 1 request per second
    Sys.sleep(1)
    retrieveBeersByBrewer(id)
  }) %>% map_dfr(parseBeers)

  return(beerDf)
}
```


Here we have functions for creating a CSV backup file for a state's beer data and adding data to the
database. The `createCsvBackup()` function takes in beer data for a state and the state's name to 
create a CSV file containing all of the data. This is for backup purposes in case something happens
to the database or if there's an error when inserting records. A file will be created for each state
and can be used to repopulate the database so to avoid making additional API requests.

The `addBeersToDatabase()` function simply takes in a data frame containing beer data and inserts it
into the database. MongoDB is used for the database.

The `dataRetrieval()` function acts as a *"main"* function and calls the necessary functions to 
retrieve all of the beer data, create the CSV backup files, and insert to the database. It gets the 
list of state information using the `parseStateUrls()` function and loops through each state, 
performing the previously mentioned operations to each of them.
```{r}
library("mongolite")
library("dplyr")
library("xml2")
library("httr")
library("rvest")
library("jsonlite")
library("purrr")

createCsvBackup <- function(stateBeerData, stateName) {
  # Creates a CSV file containing the given state's beer data and names it using the given state 
  # name.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   stateBeerData: the data frame of beer data to write to the CSV file
  #   stateName: the string state name used to create the file name
  # 
  # Returns:
  # 
  
  filename <- paste("./", gsub(" ", "", stateName, fixed = TRUE), "_Beers.csv", sep = "")
  
  write.csv(stateBeerData, filename)
}

addBeersToDatabase <- function(beerData) {
  # Adds the given beer data to the MongoDB database.
  # 
  # Args:
  #   beerData: the data frame of beer data
  # 
  # Returns:
  # 
  
  conn <- mongo(collection = "Beers", db = "DS4100")
  conn$insert(beerData)
  rm(conn)
  gc()
}

dataRetrieval <- function() {
  # Retrieves the beer data for each state, creates a CSV file containing the data, and adds it to
  # the database.
  # 
  # Args:
  # 
  # Returns:
  # 
  
  # gets the list of states (contains the name, ID, and URL)
  states <- parseStateUrls()
  
  # loops through each state and retrieves data for every beer from that state
  for (i in 1:length(states)) {
    currentState <- states[[i]]
    print(paste("Current state:", currentState$name))
    # all of the beers for the current state
    beersForState <- retrieveBeersByState(currentState)
    # creates a backup CSV file for the current state's beer data
    createCsvBackup(beersForState, currentState$name)
    # adds all of the current state's beer data to the database
    addBeersToDatabase(beersForState)
  }
}

startTime <- Sys.time()
dataRetrieval()
endTime <- Sys.time()

# prints the execution time for the dataRetrieval() function
print(endTime - startTime)
```
